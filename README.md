This is a secure, real-time personal chat application built exclusively for communication between two users only. Designed with simplicity and privacy in mind, it provides a clean and minimal UI for seamless one-on-one conversations. The app uses Socket.IO for real-time bidirectional messaging and Node.js with Express on the backend, paired with a responsive React.js frontend.

It is ideal for personal or professional use cases such as private conversations, therapy sessions, teacher-student interaction, or secure discussions between two fixed users.
